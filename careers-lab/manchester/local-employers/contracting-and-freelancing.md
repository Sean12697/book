 # Finding freelance and contract work in software engineering

It is very common for companies to employ software engineers and other technical staff as contractors, for short periods of time, rather than as employees. Consequently, there is lots of work available in freelance and contract work. The sites below could help you bid for work available as a self-employed contractor and freelancer

* TopTal [toptal.com](https://www.toptal.com) You need to interview to get invited to join the network
* UpWork [upwork.com](https://www.upwork.com) Can be quite heavy on fees but lots of leads
* Freelancer [freelancer.co.uk](https://www.freelancer.co.uk) - A lot of (overseas) competition, but still plenty of work
* Fiverr [fiverr.com](https://www.fiverr.com) another marketplace for freelancers

The key to getting contract / freelance work via these website is to get good reviews

You could start out by offering low prices and bidding on smaller projects to get a good reputation before starting to focus on larger, higher paid projects.

To find projects where you can work directly with the client (without going through a broker or agent), a good place to start is attending meetups in Manchester and go along with some business cards. Organisations like [technw.uk](http://technw.uk), [meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com) and [eventbrite.co.uk](http://www.eventbrite.co.uk) etc are all good places to start looking.

Other good leads are friends and family, can you develop software that solves a problem that your friends or family have?

I guess it depends, they can be useful for building a portfolio but I think getting a relevant summer job (e.g. with a local design/dev agency) and putting that on your CV can be more useful. If you are going to use the sites you have to be aware that you'll be paid next to nothing and will be competing with freelancers in countries with much lower costs of living.
